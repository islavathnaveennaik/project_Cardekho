Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can estimate the price of a used car. By analyzing various features such as 'Kilometers Driven', 'Fuel Type', 'Transmission', 'Car Age', and 'Brand', we aim to identify the key factors influencing car prices and build a robust model for accurate predictions.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of car listings from several Indian cities. It is provided as multiple CSV files, one for each city:

bangalore_cars.xlsx - bangalore_cars.csv.csv

chennai_cars.xlsx - chennai_cars.csv.csv

delhi_cars.xlsx - delhi_cars.csv.csv

hyderabad_cars clean_data.xlsx - hyderabad_cars.csv.csv

jaipur_cars.xlsx - jaipur_cars.csv.csv

kolkata_cars.xlsx - kolkata_cars.csv.csv

Each file contains information about used cars, including:

Name: Full name of the car model.

Location: City where the car is listed.

Year: Manufacturing year of the car.

Kilometers Driven: Total kilometers the car has been driven.

Fuel Type: Type of fuel the car uses (e.g., Petrol, Diesel).

Transmission: Type of transmission (Manual, Automatic).

Owner Type: Number of previous owners.

Mileage: Fuel efficiency of the car.

Engine: Engine displacement in CC.

Power: Engine power in BHP.

Seats: Number of seats.

Price: Selling price of the car (target variable).

Project Structure
The project is structured into sequential steps typically followed in a data science workflow, implemented as a series of code cells suitable for Google Colab.

Key Steps
1. Data Loading and Combination
All individual city CSV files are loaded into pandas DataFrames.

These DataFrames are then combined into a single, comprehensive DataFrame (all_cars_df) for unified processing.

Initial inspection of data shape, head, info, and missing values is performed.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Missing Values Handling: Missing numerical values are imputed using the median, and missing categorical values are filled using the mode.

Data Type Conversion:

The Price column is cleaned (removing currency symbols and commas) and converted to a numeric type.

The Kilometers Driven and Mileage columns are similarly cleaned and converted to numeric types.

Feature Engineering:

A new feature Car_Age is created from the Year column (Current Year - Manufacturing Year).

The Brand of the car is extracted from the Name column.

Rows with invalid or unconvertible Price, Kilometers Driven, Year, or Mileage values are dropped.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations are generated using matplotlib and seaborn to understand data distributions and relationships:

Distribution of Car Prices: Histogram.

Price vs. Kilometers Driven: Scatter plot.

Price vs. Car Age: Scatter plot.

Price by Fuel Type: Box plot.

Price by Transmission Type: Box plot.

Top Car Brands by Average Price: Bar plot.

Correlation Matrix: Heatmap for numerical features to identify correlations.

4. Model Building
Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected, and redundant/non-useful columns are dropped (e.g., original Name, Year).

Data Splitting: The dataset is split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

Preprocessing Pipeline:

Numerical features are passed through directly.

Categorical features are transformed using One-Hot Encoding to convert them into a numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

Model Training: A LinearRegression model is trained on the preprocessed training data.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is assessed on the test set using:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the average absolute difference between actual and predicted prices.

R-squared (R2) Score: Indicates the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that can be predicted from the independent variables.

Visualization: A scatter plot shows actual vs. predicted car prices on the test set.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: Numerical operations.

Matplotlib: Data visualization.

Seaborn: Enhanced data visualization.

Scikit-learn: Machine learning model building and evaluation.

How to Run (Google Colab)
Open Google Colab: Go to colab.research.google.com and create a new notebook.

Upload Data: Upload all the CSV files listed in the Dataset section to your Colab session storage (click the folder icon on the left sidebar, then the upload icon).

Copy and Run Code: Copy the code provided in each step (from the notebook or the instructions) into separate cells in your Colab notebook and run them sequentially.

Future Enhancements
Explore More Models: Experiment with other regression models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM) for potentially better performance.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to find optimal hyperparameters for chosen models.

Advanced Feature Engineering: Create more complex features (e.g., interaction terms, polynomial features).

Outlier Detection and Treatment: Implement more sophisticated methods to handle outliers.

Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation for a more robust evaluation of model performance.

Deployment: Explore deploying the trained model as a web service (e.g., using Flask/Streamlit).
